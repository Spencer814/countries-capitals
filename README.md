Countries and Capitals
======================

An app that allows users to search and visualize data about countries and capital cities
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was built with Angular and Bootstrap. I also used the Geonames API to retrieve JSON data about each country, which I linked to wikipedia to provide more info for the user. This was the first project that I tested with Karma and Jasmine.

The main thing I learned while working on this was the importance of unit-testing.

*To Do*
- *modal view for wikipedia article and maps*
- *add more demograpic info*
- *add weather info*
- *replace picture of map with Google Maps*
- *make into hybrid app*
- *implement continuous integration with Travis*
